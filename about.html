    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a student at the University of Montana. Currently I am in my second year <br>
    of studying computer science. Computer science was my choice of degree starting freshmen <br>
    year of college. The thought of solving real life problems using computer code <br>
    intersted me highly.  </p>
    <p>I am fairly young and my coding knowledge definitely lacks a little. However, I <br>
    love learning and practicing all the material. I hope to become a very talented coder<br>
    one day and I am excited to track my progress through this portfolio.</p>
